                <h2>From Paper to Presence</h2>
                <p>When I was younger, I spent a lot of time sketching. What fascinated me wasn't accuracy — it was the moment when a few lines could suggest depth, movement, or mood. A sketch never fully reproduces what you see, yet somehow it captures something real: intention, atmosphere, a feeling of being there. </p>
                <p>I learned early on that representation is not just about translating 3D into 2D. It's about choosing what to preserve — and what can be left unsaid.</p>
                <p>That question stayed with me.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="about-section fade-in-section">
                <h2>Learning to Work With Abstractions</h2>
                <p>I later found myself studying data science, working with another kind of abstraction: numbers, patterns, models. I learned how to describe human behavior through data — how to compress complex realities into something measurable and communicable.</p>
                <p>
                    But something felt incomplete.<br>
                    Data could explain <em>what</em> was happening, sometimes even <em>why</em>.<br>
                    It rarely captured <em>how it felt</em>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I kept wondering:<br>
                    What happens to experience when we reduce it too much?<br>
                    What gets lost — and what might be preserved differently?

                <h2>Encountering XR</h2>
                <p>During my undergraduate years, I took a course in interactive computing and began experimenting with digital interaction.
                    Around that time, I first encountered XR through the NYU Reality Lab.
                </p>
                <p>It wasn't perfect. The devices were limited. The visuals were sometimes rough. The illusion could break.</p>           
                <p>But despite those limitations, something important happened.</p>
                <p>XR didn't try to describe space — it <em>placed</em> you inside one.<br>It didn't ask you to imagine — it let you move, look around, and orient yourself.</p>
                <p>For the first time, I saw a medium that treated <em>presence itself</em> as a form of communication.</p>
                <p>That shift mattered to me more than realism ever could.</p>
             </div>

            <div class="about-section fade-in-section">
                <h2>What I'm Exploring Now</h2>
                <p>Today, I'm a graduate student in data science, still working with abstractions — but I'm increasingly drawn to building experiences instead of explanations.</p>
                <p>I'm interested in XR not as spectacle, and not as entertainment, but as a way to make experiences more accessible.</p>
                <p>To let people learn by being there.<br>
                    To understand through movement, space, and interaction.<br>
                    To encounter ideas without needing them fully translated into words or numbers.
                </p>
                <p>I see XR as a bridge between analysis and intuition — between knowing <em>about</em> something and sensing it directly.</p>

                    <p>
                        I was curious about the relationship between control mechanics and spatial experience. 
                        In VR and 3D environments, we often think of interaction as either body-based or controller-based. 
                        But what happens when you use a simple 2D input like mouse movement to navigate a 3D space? 
                        How does that constraint shape what's possible?

                        <strong>The user does:</strong> Move the mouse to control a blade in 3D space, slicing through fruits that fall from above.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>The system responds:</strong> Fruits react with physics, breaking apart when hit. 
                        The 3D camera perspective updates with mouse movement, creating a sense of spatial depth.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>The perception:</strong> Despite using just a mouse, there's a strong sense of presence in 3D space—
                        the constraint becomes the mechanic itself.

                    <p>
                        <strong>Input tracking:</strong> Mouse position is mapped to both blade position and camera angle.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Spatial rendering:</strong> Three.js handles 3D rendering; fruit positions are calculated in world space.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Collision detection:</strong> Simple AABB (axis-aligned bounding box) checks determine when the blade intersects fruit.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Feedback:</strong> Visual breaking animations and score updates create immediate sensory response.

                    <h2>What I Learned</h2>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Constraint breeds creativity:</strong> The limitation of mouse-based input forced interesting design choices. 
                        It wasn't about replicating VR—it was about finding what mouse input could do uniquely.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Spatial presence isn't about fidelity:</strong> Players felt genuinely present in the space 
                        even though the graphics were simple and the input method was 2D.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Next steps:</strong> I'd like to explore hybrid input—combining mouse with other modalities 
                        (like voice or gesture) to see how that changes the spatial experience further.

                    <p>
                        I was thinking about translation—not just language, but the way emotions and intentions 
                        get transformed as they travel from one person to another. 
                        What if we could make those transformations visible? 
                        What if emotion itself became the data being passed through the system?

                        Their emotion (detected via facial recognition) and their words (captured via speech-to-text) become input.

                        <strong>The system responds:</strong> The message gets transformed through three canvases:

                        the result is displayed as abstract representations rather than literal text.

                    <p>
                        <strong>Facial recognition:</strong> A pre-trained model detects emotion (happy, sad, surprised, etc.) 
                        and maps it to visual parameters.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Speech-to-text:</strong> Real-time transcription captures what's being said.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Three-canvas transformation:</strong> Each canvas applies different algorithmic transformations 
                        (glitch effects, color shifts, word scrambling) to show progressive "degradation" of the message.

                    <h2>What I Learned</h2>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Emotion as data is complex:</strong> Facial recognition can detect surface emotions, 
                        but it misses nuance. The system sometimes got it wrong—and those failures were actually more interesting.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Abstraction can communicate better than literal representation:</strong> 
                        By refusing to show the exact words or emotions, the piece invited interpretation rather than consumption.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Next steps:</strong> I wanted to make this physical. What if the transformation wasn't just visual? 
                        This eventually led to Worry Blower.

                    <h2>Why I Built This</h2>
                    <p>
                        After building Unravel the Message, I wondered: what if the system didn't just show emotion, 
                        but responded to it with physical presence? 
                        What if people could interact with something that literally breathes with them?

                        <strong>The user does:</strong> Stand in front of the installation. 
                        Your face is recognized, your voice is heard, your worries are captured.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>The system responds:</strong> A mechanical fan controlled by Arduino responds to your emotional state. 
                        LED lights shift color based on detected emotion. The installation literally breathes—
                        exhaling and inhaling in sync with your emotional energy.

                    <p>
                        <strong>The perception:</strong> You're not just interacting with a screen. 
                        The system's presence in the room makes the interaction feel reciprocal—
                        it's not just reading you; it's responding with its own physical presence.

                    <p>
                        <strong>Gear mechanism:</strong> Mechanical gears translate motor rotation into fan blade movement, 
                        creating that visceral sense of "breathing."

                        <strong>Physical presence changes everything:</strong> The same emotion-sensing system felt fundamentally different 
                        when it had a body. People took it more seriously. They felt more heard.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Technical constraints taught design lessons:</strong> The fan had limited speed range, 
                        so we had to be creative about how emotion mapped to breath rate.

                    <p>
                        <strong>Next steps:</strong> Explore multi-sensory feedback—what if the installation could also produce sound or heat? 
                        How would that deepen the sense of presence further?

                        <strong>Constraints shape creativity:</strong> Each modeling challenge required different technical approaches, 
                        which taught me flexibility.
